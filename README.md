# Tic-Tac-Toe

This is my try on Tic-Tac-Toe with JavaScript

The class Game includes basically everything you need to play the game.

´´´
class Game
´´´

The class Person creates an object, that includes the name of the player, the property "hasWon" and the sign of the player

´´´
class Player {
constructor(name) {
this.name = name;
this.sign = "";
this.hasWon = false;
}
setSign(sign) {
this.sign = sign;
}
}
´´´
